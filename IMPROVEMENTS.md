# Improvements
This file contains the changes that should be conducted to improve the code further, but haven't been performed.

1. UserInputHandler: The parsing of the user input is repeated throughout the code, this should be extracted and added to a different method.
2. GalacticService and MetalService: These two classes are very similar to each other, a superclass should be extracted to avoid code duplication.
3. Move the classes into different packages.
